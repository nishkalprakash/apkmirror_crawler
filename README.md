+There is a dependance on MongoDB (for fetching jobs and keeping track)...
+The code runs asyncronously utilizing maximum resources available...
+The inherent rate limit after trial and error (a lot of 15 min bans, :p) turned out to be 1req/s to fetch from apkmirror and 1req/s to direct push to goolge drive
+To crawl the entire space of 1million, we would need ~11.55 days...
+The main driver code is in apk_rclone.py
